Algorithm for Linear Queue
Initialize Queue:

Set front = -1 and rear = -1

Create an array arr with size 5

isEmpty():

If front == -1 and rear == -1, return true (queue is empty)

Else return false

isFull():

If rear == 4, return true (queue is full)

Else return false

enqueue(value):

If queue is full, print "Queue is full" and stop

Else if queue is empty, set front = 0 and rear = 0

Else increase rear by 1

Insert value at arr[rear]

dequeue():

If queue is empty, print "Queue is empty" and stop

Else if only one element (front == rear), take value at arr[front], reset front = rear = -1

Else take value at arr[front] and increase front by 1

Return the taken value

count():

If empty, return 0

Else return rear - front + 1

display():

Print all elements in the array from 0 to 4

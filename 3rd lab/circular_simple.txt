âœ… Algorithm for Circular Queue (Size = 5)
Initialize Queue:
Set front = -1 and rear = -1

Create an array arr of size 5

Set itemCount = 0

isEmpty():
If front == -1 and rear == -1, return true (Queue is empty)

Else return false

isFull():
If (rear + 1) % 5 == front, return true (Queue is full)

Else return false

enqueue(value):
If queue is full, print "Queue is full" and stop

Else if queue is empty (front == -1 and rear == -1), set front = 0 and rear = 0

Else set rear = (rear + 1) % 5

Insert value at arr[rear]

Increase itemCount by 1

dequeue():
If queue is empty, print "Queue is empty" and stop

Else if only one element (front == rear):

Take value at arr[front]

Reset front = rear = -1

Else:

Take value at arr[front]

Set front = (front + 1) % 5

Decrease itemCount by 1

Return the taken value

count():
Return itemCount

display():
Print all elements in the array from index 0 to 4 (entire array)
